# 1st-Experiment-
Design Common Source Amplifier using NMOS MOSFET in (tsmc 018nm) technology in Laboratory using LT spice software.
# introduction to Amplifier.
# what is Amplifier?
An amplifier is an electronic device.
It increases the strength of a weak signal.The output signal is stronger but has the same shape as input.
# what is Common source Amplifier?
A Common Source (CS) amplifier is a MOSFET amplifier in which the source terminal is common to both input and output, the input is applied at the gate, and the output is taken from the drain, providing voltage amplification with 180° phase shift.
